  Remember that afformations are so powerful because:
  <ul>
    <li> your mind subsconsciously answers the questions you ask it</li>
    <li> afformations can be used to reword negative thoughts into positive ones</li>
    <li> underlying many afformations lie the assumption that you have, can, or will achieve your goals</li>
  </ul>
